# Modelling Neonatal Vaccination with an SIR Model in R

### Final Lab – *Developing the SIR Model* by Imperial College London on Coursera

This project applies infectious disease modeling to evaluate the impact of **neonatal vaccination** on reducing endemic prevalence in a livestock population. It synthesizes all key mechanisms covered in the course to simulate a realistic SIR model using R.

---

## Skills and Concepts Practiced

- ✅ Compartmental modelling using **SIR dynamics**
- ✅ Implementation of **population turnover** (birth and natural death rates)
- ✅ Modelling **vaccination at birth** (neonatal coverage)
- ✅ Exploring **lifelong vs. waning immunity**
- ✅ Using **ODE solvers** in R via `deSolve`
- ✅ **Sensitivity analysis** on vaccine coverage and immunity duration
- ✅ Clear visualization of prevalence and impact scenarios using `ggplot2`
- ✅ Providing **policy recommendations** based on model outputs

## 💡 Scenario Overview

You are tasked with advising the Ministry of Agriculture on how a new neonatal vaccine would impact an endemic disease in livestock. You explore the following:

1. **Baseline endemic prevalence** with lifelong immunity  
2. **Impact of increasing vaccine coverage** to reduce prevalence  
3. **Possibility of disease elimination** with high neonatal coverage  
4. **Scenarios with waning immunity** (1 year, 2.5 years)  
5. **Evaluation of adjuvants** (vaccine promoters)  
6. **Policy recommendations & assumptions analysis**

## 🔧 Tools Used

- `R`
- `deSolve` for ODE simulation
- `ggplot2` for visualization
- `reshape2` for data transformation
